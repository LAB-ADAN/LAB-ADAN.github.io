###  About Me

Hi, I'm **Reza** ‚Äî passionate about **Cloud + Network Automation (NetDevOps)**.  
This blog documents my continuous learning journey across AWS, DevOps, and Infrastructure Engineering.  
Expect practical notes, architectural insights, and publishable mini-projects built from real-world experience.

This entire effort is dedicated to **my father**, who passed away recently.  
He was the person who first sparked my curiosity and passion for technology. Every post and project here is a continuation of that inspiration ‚Äî a way to honor the love for learning and problem-solving that I inherited from him.
