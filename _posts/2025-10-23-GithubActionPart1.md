## Getting Your Mind Ready: GitHub Basics
Before diving into automation, let’s quickly review a few key terms in the context of a GitHub repository (a project folder):

- **Issues**: These are like to-do lists or bug reports. When you find a problem or have an idea for a new feature, you create an Issue.
- **Contributors**: Anyone who helps improve the code, often by creating Pull Requests or providing feedback via Issues.

- **Pull Request (PR)** : is how you **ask to add your changes** to someone else’s project.
**Simple flow:**
1. Make changes in your own copy (a **branch**).  
2. Create a **Pull Request (PR)**.  
3. Project maintainers **review** your changes.  
4. If approved, your changes are **merged** into the main project.
